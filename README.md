# Wordle Pt. 1 Starter

Submitted by: **Kaijun Chen**

**Wordle** is a popular word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word chosen by the game. Each guess must be a valid five-letter word, and after each guess, the color of the letters changes to show how close the guess was to the word.

- If a letter is in the correct position, it turns green.
- If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it turns yellow.
- If a letter is not in the word at all, it turns gray.
